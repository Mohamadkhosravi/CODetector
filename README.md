# CO gass
CO gas, also known as carbon monoxide gas, is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas composed of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, with the chemical formula CO. It is often referred to as carbon monoxide because it contains one less oxygen atom than carbon dioxide (CO2).

Carbon monoxide is produced through incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels, such as gasoline, natural gas, wood, and coal. When these fuels do not burn completely due to a lack of oxygen, carbon monoxide is one of the byproducts formed.

Carbon monoxide is highly toxic to humans and animals when inhaled because it binds strongly to hemoglobin in red blood cells, preventing them from carrying oxygen to vital tissues and organs. This can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, which can be life-threatening. 

Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, shortness of breath, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness or death.

To prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, it's essential to have proper ventilation in areas where combustion processes occur and to install carbon monoxide detectors in homes and buildings where carbon monoxide may be generated, such as those with gas appliances or heating systems

This project is used to measure and warn of CO gas
